 How to Compile and Run

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Compile
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run
./output
```

 On Windows:
```bash
# Compile
gcc filename.c -o output.exe

# Run
output.exe
```

Using online compilers:
You can also use online C compilers like:
- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
